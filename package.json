  "description": "The car-api is a simple RESTful API that allows users to manage a collection of cars. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for cars, including creating a new car, retrieving a list of all cars, retrieving a single car by ID, updating an existing car, and deleting a car by ID. The API is built using Node.js and Express.js, and the data is stored in a JSON file using the lowdb library. It includes basic validation to ensure that required fields are present when creating or updating a car.",
